### To get the more understanding on why we subtract the mean and divide by variance is given below:
### Subtract the mean: suppose we have a temp scale of C and Kelvin scales, subtract the mean from the data will remove the influence of the scale on the data and making the mean of the data ` to 0 but still there will be effect of the degree in respective scales to remove that too we divide by the variance so that it will be independant of the scales (this is called Z-score) which is commonly used in ML to standardize the data available to us
